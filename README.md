# CAPM Analysis with Fama-French Factors

## Overview

This repository contains a data analysis project that implements the **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)** using **Fama-French** financial data. The analysis explores the relationship between portfolio returns and market factors to assess asset pricing models.

## Repository Structure


- **`data/`**: Contains the modified CSV files used for analysis.
  - `Fama_French_Factors (Only Monthly).csv`: Monthly Fama-French factor data processed for the project.
  - `Ports_Average Value Weighted Returns.csv`: Average value-weighted returns of portfolios.

- **`original_data/`**: Stores the original, unmodified CSV files.
  - `Fama_French_Factors (Only Monthly).csv`: Original Fama-French factor data.
  - `Ports_Average Value Weighted Returns.csv`: Original portfolio returns data.

- **`CAPM with Fama-French Factors.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for CAPM analysis using the Fama-French factors, specifically designed for execution in Google Colab.
